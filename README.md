# digMoundGame
Hello and welcome to digMoundGame! digMoundGame is a digging game created by scrundae where you use the mouse cursor to pick up ores like emerald, lead, diamond, serendibite and also a *made up* rare ore titled "blazore", which is worth a lot of money.
# Currency
When you collect ores, you get a currency called "caches". More expensive things get you more caches.
